<h1>CAIR: Community Augmented Incident Response</h1>


<P>This was originally part of the 2016 AEC Hackathon. The goal was to create this mockup of a system for being able to report emergencies. By having community driven alerts about any emergencies/incidents occurring, first-responders would be better equipped to understand the urgency and severity of the situation. A way to send useful data and details about an emergency. This would include 3 parts: an interface for describing details of incident (where/when/how many affected), a way to splice together images from an incident to get a better understanding, and a 3d-rendering of aggregate data about incidents in a particular area </P>
